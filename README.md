# EmoSense: Emotion Detection and Speech Therapy App for People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
EmoSense is an application that provides a place for people with ASD to practice their emotional interpretation and some additional features such as a community platform for sharing experiences and support, health and community articles, and recommendations regarding clinic/therapy locations. This application targets the family members of people with ASD, hence the main users will be them. This application is expected to be a safe place for the family members to engage with their children/siblings who live with ASD more. In this project, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions into seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.
